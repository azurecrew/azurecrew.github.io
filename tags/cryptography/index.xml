As companies collect and store vast amounts of data, they must also take measures to protect sensitive client and business information. Data encryption and anonymization at ingestion are two essential techniques that organizations can use to ensure data privacy.
Data encryption involves converting plain text data into an encoded format, which can only be accessed through a secret key. This technique ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the encryption key. Encryption can be applied to various types of data, including emails, files, and databases.</description></item><item><title>SecOps: distribution, storage, and rotation of secrets at run time</title><link>https://azurecrew.github.io/blog/2023-05-01-secops-secret-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://azurecrew.github.io/blog/2023-05-01-secops-secret-management/</guid><description>In the world of cybersecurity, SecOps (Security Operations) is an approach that combines security and operations teams to secure the organization&amp;rsquo;s systems, data, and infrastructure. One of the key aspects of SecOps is managing secrets - sensitive information such as passwords, access keys, and certificates. In this blog, we will discuss the distribution, storage, and rotation of secrets at run time.
Distribution of Secrets In SecOps, secrets need to be distributed securely to the relevant systems and applications. The first step in the distribution process is to encrypt the secrets. This ensures that even if the secrets are intercepted during transmission, they cannot be read by unauthorized parties.</description></item></channel></rss>
