One of the key aspects of SecOps is managing secrets - sensitive information such as passwords, access keys, and certificates. In this blog, we will discuss the distribution, storage, and rotation of secrets at run time.
Distribution of Secrets In SecOps, secrets need to be distributed securely to the relevant systems and applications. The first step in the distribution process is to encrypt the secrets. This ensures that even if the secrets are intercepted during transmission, they cannot be read by unauthorized parties.</description></item></channel></rss>
