As companies collect and store vast amounts of data, they must also take measures to protect sensitive client and business information. Data encryption and anonymization at ingestion are two essential techniques that organizations can use to ensure data privacy.
Data encryption involves converting plain text data into an encoded format, which can only be accessed through a secret key. This technique ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read without the encryption key. Encryption can be applied to various types of data, including emails, files, and databases.</description></item></channel></rss>
